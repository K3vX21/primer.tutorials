<p>This document reviews some of the technical details behind the special modifications we have made to the basic tutorial technology. It is only of interest to those thinking of modifying the current approach. It also includes some items worth investigating and/or fixing.</p>
<div id="showing-r-code-chunks" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#showing-r-code-chunks" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Showing R code chunks</h2>
<p>Sometimes in tutorials, you might want to show the entire r code chunk. An example is in the “Rstudio and Friends” tutorial.</p>
<p>Before, we had a trick of adding an empty r string after a code chunk definition to display the chunk as a whole. The way to display chunks that way is discussed <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/verbatim-code-chunks.html" class="external-link">here</a> in more detail.</p>
<p>Below is an example of using the empty r string.</p>
<p><img src="images/empty_string_1.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>It is strongly discouraged for tutorial makers to use `r’’` in tutorials to show code chunks. Instead, as of now, we encourage just including photos.</p>
<p>This is because <strong>parsermd</strong> — which is used in <code><a href="../reference/submission_functions.html">primer.tutorials::submission_server()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/format_tutorial.html">primer.tutorials::format_tutorial()</a></code> to read and parse tutorial Rmd documents — fails if `r’’` appears.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rundel/parsermd/issues/27" class="external-link">An issue is raised on github</a> for the <strong>parsermd</strong> package creator, Colin Rundel, to fix this. It is, however, not top priority. He instead offered a workaround other than using an image.</p>
<p>The workaround uses a zero-width space to stop the knitr from knitting that code chunk. The example Professor Rundel pointed to is <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples/blob/master/065-rmd-chunk.Rmd" class="external-link">an Rmd document written by Yihui</a>. The example includes more details about how zero-width space works and how to implement the space When it’s used in RStudio, the editor does highlight the existence of zero-width spaces with a red dot.</p>
<p><img src="images/zero_width_space_1.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>With that being said, we still encourage including images of the code chunks with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/knitr/man/include_graphics.html" class="external-link">knitr::include_graphics()</a></code> like below:</p>

<a href="#package-locations" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Package locations</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that there are (at least) two versions of <strong>primer.tutorials</strong> installed on your machine. In my case, we have</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="ex">/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.1/Resources/library</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>The first is the default location for packages. This is where things go unless you do something special. The second is installed in the <code>renv</code> directory which you created within your <code>primer.tutorials</code> project. When you are working in your <code>primer.tutorials</code> project, as you generally will, the <code>renv</code> version of the <strong>primer.tutorials</strong> library is what you will be using.</p>

<p>Every tutorial must load the <strong>learnr</strong> package in order to function. <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library(primer.tutorials)</a></code> is always included because it contains the file, <code>submissions_functions.R</code>, which enables answer downloading. All our tutorials need the <strong>tidyverse</strong>. You may need to add other packages which are used in your tutorial. Any such packages also need to be included in the DESCRIPTION file.</p>
<p><code>echo = FALSE</code> is a handy default because, most of the time, we don’t show users the code. Setting the <code>tutorial.exercise.timelimit</code> to 60 seconds is safe, but probably not necessary. <code>tutorial.storage</code> must be set to <code>local</code> to ensure that user work is saved between sessions.</p>
<p>For the setup code chunks, the first chunk is written in javascript and the second is written in R.</p>
<p>The pipeline works as such:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>When a button to transfer code is clicked, it triggers the <code>"onclick"</code> event, which calls the function <code>transfer_code()</code>, passing the button element itself as an argument.</p></li>
<li><p><code>transfer_code()</code> is a javascript function defined in the first code chunk that retrieves the current exercise label from an html element after it is compiled. This works by selecting the desired html element relative to the button element passed from the <code>"onclick"</code> event. The function then sets a Shiny server input variable called <code>js_to_server</code> to the current exercise label.</p></li>
<li><p>The action of setting <code>js_to_server</code> to a new variable triggers a Shiny server event defined in the second code chunk. This event gets the previous exercise’s submission and sends that code as well as the current exercise label back to javascript through a custom Shiny message called <code>"set-exercise-code"</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The message is received in javascript in the first code chunk. Javascript then finds the current code chunk and then <strong>overwrites</strong> the text in the current code chunk with the text from the previous code chunk.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Process to Current Stage:</strong> This function was suggested by Preceptor for simpler user experience in long tutorials that require pipe-building across multiple exercises. There were 2 main options in achieving this.</p>
<p>First was to have the code of the current exercise automatically copied to user clipboards when clicking the <code>"Run Code"</code> button.</p>
<p>Second was to have the code of the current exercise automatically copied and pasted to the next exercise chunk after some simplified action.</p>
<p>After a swift response from user grrrck on this <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/learnr-clipboard-extension/107812" class="external-link">RStudio Community Thread</a>, a clearer direction was laid out. I implemented the answer suggested but Preceptor pointed out that a lot of copy/pasting from the tutorial-maker’s side was required. The problem then was how to minimize the amount of code needed to be repeatedly copied/pasted. Since the answer suggested used actionButtons from Shiny which had little room for customization, we thought there wasn’t a way to know which exercise was locally close to the button.</p>
<p>Therefore, I created a second version that was a bit “brute-force” by having arguments for the code chunks that had the actionButtons, then reading the file itself to find those arguments and extract the labels of the exercise. But that was still a lot of code to copy/paste and God forbid someone wants to insert a new exercise at the beginning because you’ll have to manually change so many exercise names that come after.</p>
<p>Here I realized that I don’t have to use Shiny’s actionButtons and can just use normal html buttons with trigger events that call a javascript function, which can directly communicate with the Shiny server, thus finally reaching the current version. Now no more exercise-specific information needs to be specified, only the exact same button for each exercise.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Improvements:</strong> Personally, I think the current solution is very close to the ideal solution. The only downsides being that 1) tutorial makers still have to include something in the exercises and 2) the button would look much better on the toolbar section of the exercise, next to <code>"Start Over"</code> and where the “hint” would be.</p>
<p>However, the possibility of automatically copying code to clipboard when clicking the <code>"Run Code"</code> button has yet been explored and could offer a better solution.</p>
<div id="rstudio-setting-questions" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#rstudio-setting-questions" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>RStudio setting questions</h3>
<p>In many settings, it is natural for a set up question to have three parts. First, run a line of code that reports on the value of something. Example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">rstudioapi</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/rstudioapi/man/readRStudioPreference.html" class="external-link">readRStudioPreference</a></span><span class="op">(</span>name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"load_workspace"</span>, default <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Code failed."</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will return TRUE, which is the default value.</p>
<p>Second, change the setting. This generally won’t return anything.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">rstudioapi</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/rstudioapi/man/writeRStudioPreference.html" class="external-link">writeRStudioPreference</a></span><span class="op">(</span>name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"load_workspace"</span>, value <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>See how the first was “read” and the second was “write”? Then, the third and final step is to confirm that the change worked by re-running the first code again.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">rstudioapi</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/rstudioapi/man/readRStudioPreference.html" class="external-link">readRStudioPreference</a></span><span class="op">(</span>name <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"load_workspace"</span>, default <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Code failed."</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And finish with a sentence that tells the student to notice that the value has changed and that it is now correct. (Of course, we “monitor” that by making them copy/paste this last command and its return from the Console into the tutorial.)</p>
</div>
<div id="other-topics" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#other-topics" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Other topics</h3>
<ul>
<li>We can use this trick to add hints to those questions: simply add a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag with an id attribute that marks it as hint for your exercise. Like this:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode markdown"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a>&lt;div id="filter-hint"&gt;</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>**Hint:** You may want to use the dplyr <span class="bn">`filter`</span> function.</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="comments-on--rbuildignore" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#comments-on--rbuildignore" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Comments on .Rbuildignore</h3>
<p>For some reason, it is impossible to include comments in the .Rbuildignore, at least by using the “#” symbol. I think the key issue is that using <code>*</code> (or maybe a parenthesis) in a line which begins with <code>#</code> causes trouble. Regardless, here are some thoughts on the current version.</p>
<p>We would like to ensure that all the junk files which end up in the <code>tutorials/*</code> directories are not included in the build. Such files are often large. They also run the risk of messing things up in that they might cause certain tests to pass for us but which would fail for anyone who downloads from Github. (The .gitignore file does a reasonable ensuring that such files do not end up on Github.)</p>
<p>The key line is:</p>
<pre><code>tutorials/[^/]*/(?!(data|images|.*Rmd))</code></pre>
<p>This excludes everything in any subdirectory of the tutorials directory except an <code>images</code> directory (a file named images would also be included) or a <code>data</code> directory or a file suffixed with “.Rmd”.</p>
<p>This entire document is in Perl-like Regex. The only significant difference from Perl in this document is that “/” do not need to be escaped with a “". The regex below, in plain English, matches (and so excludes) a path which begins with the characters”tutorials/"“, and after those has any number (<em>) of characters except a "/" ([^/]), and after those has a "/", and after those does not have (?!…) either the characters "images" or (|) any number (</em>) of any character (.) followed by the characters”Rmd". If we used .* instead of defining the character class in [^/]*, the regex would evaluate the negative lookahead after the last “/” in the path. The files within the images directory would then be excluded, because they do neither the characters “images” or a string ending in “Rmd” after their last “/”.</p>
</div>
<div id="adding-more-libraries" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#adding-more-libraries" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Adding more libraries</h3>
<p>If you are using a new library, there are several things you need to check. First, most obviously, you should install the package within the <code>primer.tutorials</code> directory. Second, you must use library(X) in the setup chunk within the tutorial.Rmd itself. Third, you need to run <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/status.html" class="external-link">renv::status()</a></code>. This should report that there is a new package which is not part of renv.lock. Then, you will need to run <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/snapshot.html" class="external-link">renv::snapshot()</a></code> so that the renv.lock file is updated. Fourth, you need to add the package to the DESCRIPTION file, in the Imports: section. (And don’t forget the comma when you do so.) If you don’t do this, then R CMD check might work on your computer, where library X is already installed, but won’t work in Github actions since R relies on the DESCRIPTION file to know which packages to install.</p>

<p>Unexported objects imported by ‘:::’ calls: ‘learnr:::get_all_state_objects’ ‘learnr:::read_request’ ‘learnr:::submissions_from_state_objects’</p>
<p>Because learnr will not export the three functions which we use in submission_functions.R, we have no choice but to use ::: in order to access them. Doing do produces a NOTE when we run R CMD check. I find that annoying. I tried just providing my own copies in submission_functions.R, but that did not work. (Perhaps the problem is that they themselves use other learnr functions which I don’t have access to?)</p>
<p>NWL Update August 14th: In the last few days, learnr has exported the functions, learnr::get_tutorial_state() and learnr::get_tutorial_info(), which eliminates the need for all functions with ‘:::’. All uses of ‘:::’ has been replaced in this package.</p>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#later-tutorials-in-later-chapters" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Later tutorials in later chapters</h3>
<p>The first tutorial for each of the later chapters is easy. Just do more or less exactly what the chapter does. Recall that, one day, we expect to incorporate those questions directly into the chapter itself. So, the more that it just forces students to type in the same commands as in the chapter, the better. But, for the most part, the chapters are not that long! There is only about one tutorial worth of material.</p>
<p>What do we do for the other 5 or so tutorials for each chapter? Good question! Honestly, I am not sure. Here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The second tutorial could be very similar to the first – and, therefore, to the chapter. Just use a different variable(s) and/or a different tibble, but answer the same sorts of questions in the same way.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be repetitive in the written questions. It is fine, in the first tutorial for each chapter, to ask students to write a definition of the Preceptor Table. Indeed, we should always have that question in each first tutorial. But, we don’t want that question in each of the 5 tutorials for a single chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Use written questions which do require different answers depending in the data/variable used. We can’t resuse “Define a Preceptor Table” because that question has the same answer every time. Consider a different question:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a paragraph which explores reasons why we should <strong>not</strong> consider the Preceptor Table and our data set as being drawn from the same population?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is a good question, not least because it needs a different answer for each data science problem we confront. Another good example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a paragraph explaining why, even though the data is not a random sample, we may still consider it to be “respsentative” enough to move forward?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this requires a different answer for each new tibble.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We don’t usually (ever?) ask questions about the four Cardinal Virtues directly. They are simply a pedagogical device we use to help students organize their work. But we do ask written questions about the key concepts (population, representativeness, validity) in each and every tutorial. These are difficult concepts with no “right” answers. We need to wrestle with them every week.</p></li>
<li><p>A tutorial after the first might do a very similar exercise but with three differences. First, it can go faster, given that students have already seen the basics fairly slowly in the first tutorial. Second, it can add some complexity, make the modeling problem just a little more difficult than the basic case. Third, it can add some new magic. Perhaps it grabs data using a new package instead of just using another boring data set from <strong>primer.data</strong>. Perhaps it creates a nicer plot with some geoms we have not used before.</p></li>
<li><p>I will distribute the problem sets we used last semester. Turning them into tutorials might work well. But always remember that tutorials are easy, while problem sets are hard. So, we need to split up a big problem set question into 15 exercises and then walk the students slowly (and with hints) through those 10 exercises.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe there are easy ways, in tutorial 2 or 3, to take the problem we solved in tutorial 1 and have it loosen the assumption that the data we have is representative of the population. This is a nice assumption to loosen since it is never true. I am not sure how one would do this . . .</p></li>
<li><p>If the main example is the chapter is one which uses a linear model, then tutorial 2 could use a logistic model and then tutorial 3 could use the third kind of model (which we have not chosen yet). Similarly, if the chapter (and first tutorial) does a predictive mode, then tutorial 3 should do a causal model.</p></li>
<li><p>The last tutorial might, in some sense, try to set the stage for the next chapter, provide a teaser for what we are learning next.</p></li>
<li><p>Another type of tutorial is one which uses fake data which has been manipulated to violate the assumptions which students are making. Show them Preceptor’s Posterior and compare it to their own.</p></li>

<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#miscellaneous-topics" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Miscellaneous topics</h3>
<p><strong>install_only_binary_packages</strong> is a function that updates the user’s .Rprofile file to only download the binary version of packages. The reason of this function is that students are often prompted to download from the source of the packages, which we do not want to happen. Therefore, by changing the .Rprofile to only downloading binary packages, students can only download from CRAN.</p>
<p>The <code>copy-code-chunk</code>, <code>info-section</code>, and <code>download-answers</code> are <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/include-custom-code-chunks-from-separate-files/109216" class="external-link">imported</a> into each tutorial. The actual Rmd of these sections are saved in the <code>inst/child_documents</code> folder. Note that the <code>setup</code> code chunk must come before all of them.</p>
</div>
<div id="permanent-objects" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#permanent-objects" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Permanent objects</h3>
<p>Permanent objects should be avoided, if possible. The problem is that each Exercise code chunk is its own “world.” It knows nothing of any actions taken in previous code chunks, except for three exceptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Any objects created in the global “setup” code chunk are available in all Exercise code chunks. The annoying thing about this option is that we would, ideally like to have the obects created near — in the Rmd — to the Exercises which use them. This also means that we can only use names like “fit_1” or “pp” once in each tutorial.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects created in a setup chunk for just one exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects created in a code chunk which is then referenced by using the exercise.setup code chunk option in any Exercise which needs access to these objects. This is probably the best approach.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But what about regular code chunks which are neither Exercise code chunks nor setup chunks. Do objects created there persist? Maybe! Sometimes!? My <em>sense</em> is that such objects are available when the tutorial is knitted. This is why we can show a plot at the end of a Section after creating it at the start. But such objects are not available at run time, which is why they are not seen in Exercises.</p>
<p>No aspect of the tutorials has given us more trouble than permanent objects. In particular, it sometimes seems like things will work with Run Document but not with Run Tutorial. Since students always do the latter, we need to test that way as well.</p>
